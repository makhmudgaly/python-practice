"""
Strings are not the only Python types that have methods associated with them. 
Lists, floats, integers and booleans are also types that come packaged with a bunch of useful methods. In this exercise, you'll be experimenting with:

index(), to get the index of the first element of a list that matches its input and
count(), to get the number of times an element appears in a list.
You'll be working on the list with the area of different parts of a house: areas.

Most list methods will change the list they're called on. Examples are:

append(), that adds an element to the list it is called on,
remove(), that removes the first element of a list that matches the input, and
reverse(), that reverses the order of the elements in the list it is called on.
You'll be working on the list with the area of different parts of the house: areas.
-----------------
Instructions

Use the index() method to get the index of the element in areas that is equal to 20.0. Print out this index.
Call count() on areas to find out how many times 9.50 appears in the list. Again, simply print out this number.
Use append() twice to add the size of the poolhouse and the garage again: 24.5 and 15.45, respectively. Make sure to add them in this order.
Print out areas
Use the reverse() method to reverse the order of the elements in areas.
Print out areas once more.

# Create list areas
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]

# Print out the index of the element 20.0
print(areas.index(20.0))

# Print out how often 9.50 appears in areas
print(areas.count(9.50))

# Use append twice to add poolhouse and garage size
areas.append(24.5)
areas.append(15.45)


# Print out areas
print(areas)

# Reverse the orders of the elements in areas
areas.reverse()

# Print out areas
print(areas)
